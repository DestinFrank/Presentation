 <h2>Job and responsibilites:</h2>
 There are a multitude of different engineering jobs, and a multitude of responsibilities, but I will quickly try to cover them. <br>
<br> To keep it short, an engineers job is to design a product for others to then refurbish and manufacture, or to do that manufacturing themselves.

            <br>What is required: <br>
            <br>1.  Advanced Functions (MHF4U)
            <br>2.  Calculus and Vectors (MCV4U)
            <br>3.  Chemistry (SCH4U)
            <br>4.  Physics (SPH4U)
            <br>5.  English (ENG4U)
            <br> <br> A minimum grade of 70% is also required.
